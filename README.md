# gwc_cyogame_workshop

This repository contains the pseudocode and Python scripts used at OU GWC's "Learning a New Language" CYO Game Workshop activity! This workshop is designed for beginner-level programmers. No prior coding experience required!

Please see all 5 pseudo files in order to see each of the 5 CS concepts we covered in action: I/O, Variables, Conditionals, Loops, and Functions.

After this, please see my personal Python implementation of the pseudocode!

All pseudo functions are directly rooted from the official Girls Who Code College Loop program curriculum. However, cyo_game.py is my original work.

Please reach out to natalia.mora@ou.edu for any questions! Thank you!
